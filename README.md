  + finite (!)
  + toroidal
  + infinite (?)
  + [1-dimensional (elementary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) cellular automata, wolfram code (?)
  + non-
+ parametric rules
  + support for different types of cell neighborhood
    + moore neighborhood (!)
    + von neumann neighborhood
    + extended von neumann neighborhood (?)
  + non-isotropic rules
  + B/S rule notation input (!)
  + more than 2 possible cell states
  + langton's ant (???)
    + [turmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite) (?????????)
  + probabilistic cellular automata (???)
+ user interface
  + curses tui (!)
  + high resolution gui (?)
  + graphical rule editor (tui/gui) (?)
  + load/store files
    + rules
    + grid state

(?): "would be cool" features
(???): "might implement in the far future" features
